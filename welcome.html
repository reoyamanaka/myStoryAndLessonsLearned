        <h1>My Story and Lessons Learned</h1>
        <p>
            My background may or may not be an unusual one. A former pre-med that went rogue and became a software developer and entrepreneur. I'd like to do a statistical analysis on it sometime. I now run a <a href="https://www.sekiju.com" target="_blank">small software business</a>, take on projects on a contract-basis and occasionally post coding tutorials on YouTube. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm blogging about how I made it here and what I'm currently working to accomplish. It's a <i>two-bird-one-stone</i> way for me to reflect on my lessons learned and for anyone interested in entering the dev field, even without a CS-degree, to perhaps take home something useful.
