        <p>
            My background may or may not be an unusual one. A former pre-med that went rogue and became a software developer and entrepreneur. It would be interesting to do a statistical analysis on it sometime. I now run a small software business and take on projects on a contract-basis. I'm blogging about my journey so that anyone interested in entering the dev field, even without a CS-degree like me, could get something useful out of it.
